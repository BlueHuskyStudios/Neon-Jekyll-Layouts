The bit of Liquid below is meant to be a way to simplify what icon goes in the top-right of the app
bar. So far I've just got GitHub, but since I'd like to push this as a generalized component, I
figured I should think of a generalized solution that'll work going forward.

This particular piece of this site came from the Neon Jekyll Layouts repo, which is part of a framework for Jekyll
sites like this! Neon is a theme I (Ben Leggiero) invented, which is heavily inspired by Google's Material Design. I
tweaked it for my needs, and is written in plain CSS as much as possible.

If you want to browse through all the current source code or see the history, check these out:

 - Neon Jekyll Components: https://github.com/BlueHuskyStudios/Neon-Jekyll-Components
 - Neon: https://github.com/BlueHuskyStudios/stylesheets/tree/master/assets/v2/neon

Since I wrote Neon from scratch, I decided to place it under the BH-1-PS license:
https://github.com/BlueHuskyStudios/Licenses/blob/master/Licenses/BH-1-PS.txt

Remember that this site might have a different license, so check for that before doing anything that might go against
it. As for Neon, feel free to take this code and use it for your own stuff! Just make sure you let everyone know I
wrote the original 😉
